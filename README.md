# Selenium screenshot demo (for mhqin)

## Intro

This is a quick demo making use of the Selenium package to take screenshots of certain websites every 10 seconds as scheduled by the schedule module. During this demo, it was found that there is no need to download the webdrivers for selenium as the webdriver_manager library can auto manage this now. 

## Requirements

Packages were installed specific to running this via pipenv, hence this should be installed
